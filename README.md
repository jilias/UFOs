# Overview of Project
This site is take a table of data and create a site that will allow for other to interact with it and filter through the data in order to find what the end user is seeking to fulfilll

# Results:
As someone enters the site, they are greeted with the following banner and a paragraph describing the nature of the site and a brief snippet of the data and opposing and supporting views surrounding the controversial topic of UFOS

As the user continues through the site, they are able to use the following filters. Any user can sift through the data via dates or location such as city, state, or country. Even a user doesn't have a specific geolocation in mind, they can search through and filter the data via a crop shape (ie circle, triangle).

# Summary:
- I think the data needs to be cleaned and edited for a sleekier and better look.
- The filters are case sensitive and I think that may be frustrating for some end users.
- The date filter is limited because it restricts users to having input an exact MM/DD/YYYY and doesn't allow for filter simply by just the Year, Month, or any combination.
- I think the data needs to be standardized.
